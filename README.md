2. When everyone you want to play with is in the waiting room, anyone can click the "Play" button to start the game
3. When it's your turn to roll, click the yellow "Roll" button
4. Keep rolling until you don't make anyone drink. The "Roll" button will go away

* Roll a 3 on either die, the 3 Man drinks
* Roll a 7, the player ahead/after of you drinks
